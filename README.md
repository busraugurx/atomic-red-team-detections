# MITRE ATT&CK Detection Rules

This repository contains a growing collection of Sigma and YARA detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

The rules are designed to reflect real-world adversary behavior rather than lab-only indicators, with a focus on execution, defense evasion, persistence, and credential access.  
Each rule is written to be practical for SOC and detection engineering use cases and is tested against known atomic or real attack patterns where possible.
